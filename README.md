# SLAM-REC-HV-version-1.0-test


![GitHub Brillante](https://github.com/MAB1144-Python/Document/blob/main/portadaV2.0_Mesa%20de%20trabajo%201.jpg)


#### In this repository you can find the compilation of the tests carried out with the REC-HV v2.0 software, with online execution and low implementation cost, for the reconstruction of static scenes by points of high variability. In this new version, the detection is carried out on the 2D LIDAR data, and the segmentation is carried out in two stages, with this the dynamic object that travels through the scene is eliminated, and a greater percentage of the static scene is recovered.

#### Rec-HV was developed in Python 3 and ROS with execution in ubuntu 18.06, it incorporates different tools, including ORB-SLAM, which is a visual odometry system. A 2D LIDAR (RPLIDAR A1) and a kinect (v1.0) were used as instruments. 

#### To show in depth the behavior of the software, a compilation of videos of the execution of the system in various scenarios is presented, and datasets of each scenario, software and different user guides are made available to the community of SLAM researchers. repository will be built by receiving contributions, opinions and new research on this area.

#### The datasets are composed of point clouds, lidar data sets, the position vector and the Euler angles for 400 recorded cycles.

#### To encourage the staggered development of this technology, researchers are encouraged to leave their opinions, doubts and contributions, in order to create spaces for the appropriation of this technology and strengthen SLAM research.

#### The respective code is in the rdslam folder, in this repository.
